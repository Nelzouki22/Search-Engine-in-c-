# Search Engine in c++
Building a full-fledged search engine like Google in C++ is a very complex task. However, you can create a simpler search engine that works on a limited dataset stored locally. Here's a breakdown of the steps and libraries you might consider:

1. Data Storage:

Choose a data structure to store your content. Options include:
Text files: Simple but can be slow for large datasets.
Databases (SQLite): More efficient for searching but requires additional setup.
In-memory data structures (hash tables, trees): Fastest but might not be suitable for very large datasets.
2. Preprocessing:

Tokenize the text content: Split it into individual words or phrases.
Remove stop words (common words like "the," "a") that don't contribute much to search relevance.
Consider stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" -> "run").
3. Indexing:

Create an index that maps words/phrases to documents or locations where they appear.
Hash tables are a good choice for fast lookups.
4. Searching:

Implement a search function that takes a query as input.
Split the query into terms and use the index to find documents containing those terms.
Rank the results based on relevance (e.g., frequency of query terms in documents, document popularity).
5. User Interface (Optional):

Create a simple command-line interface or a graphical interface (using libraries like SFML) to take user input and display results.
Libraries to Consider:

C++ Standard Library (STL): Provides containers (e.g., vector, map) and algorithms (e.g., find, sort) for data storage and manipulation.
Regular Expressions (optional): Libraries like Boost.Regex can be helpful for handling complex search patterns.
This is a simplified example. A real search engine would involve more sophisticated techniques and optimizations. Remember, this is for educational purposes and won't handle large datasets efficiently.
